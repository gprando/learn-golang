Moore's law basically predicted that the density of transistors in processors would double every 18 months, it will not be valid forever, bumping into the limitations of silicon in working with stability, the solution to increase the processing power of processors is to make use of intense parallelism.
Transistors consume energy and if we have more transistor density CPU temperature will increase, as transistor density decreases (increasing processing), temperature increases considerably, another point is also that voltage scaling reduces dynamic power consumption to same which is limited due to voltage noise
